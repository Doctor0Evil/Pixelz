# Pixelz 🎨

Pixelz is a **BCI‑friendly** pixel‑art and animation program designed so children, people with disabilities, and slower‑learners can create, draw, and play with minimal friction and maximum fun.[conversation_history:1] It aims to be the “MS Paint for BCI devices” — free, open‑source, and focused on safe entertainment for everyone.[conversation_history:1]

---

## Why Pixelz?

- Accessible pixel‑art editor for EEG/BCI devices, eye‑tracking, and traditional inputs (mouse, touch, keyboard).[conversation_history:1]  
- Built for younger generations, rehabilitation contexts, and users who benefit from simplified, guided interfaces.[conversation_history:1]  
- Focused on creativity, calm play, and art‑based learning instead of high‑pressure, competitive gameplay.[conversation_history:1]  

---

## Core Features

- **Pixel‑Art Canvas**  
  - Small, low‑cognitive‑load canvases (e.g., 16×16, 32×32, 64×64) with layer support.[conversation_history:1]  
  - Basic tools: pencil, fill, eraser, color picker, simple shapes, onion‑skin animation.[conversation_history:1]  

- **BCI‑Aware Interaction**  
  - Non‑invasive signal mapping (e.g., fatigue/engagement index) to adjust difficulty, hints, and pacing — never direct motor control.[conversation_history:1]  
  - Gentle session timers and break prompts when cognitive load stays high.[conversation_history:1]  

- **Guided Play Modes**  
  - Step‑by‑step drawing helpers, tracing overlays, and “color‑by‑grid” mini‑games for new or slower‑learning artists.[conversation_history:1]  
  - Kid‑safe defaults: no chats, no ads, no pay‑to‑win, no weaponized content.[conversation_history:1]  

---

## Safety & Ethics

Pixelz is explicitly **non‑weaponized**, reality‑safe, and intended only for artistic expression, education, and medical/rehab‑friendly play.[conversation_history:1]  

- No subliminal stimulation, no invasive control channels, and no unsafe BCI outputs.  
- Compatible with medical/rehab scenarios for monitoring and gentle adaptation, not diagnosis or treatment decisions.[conversation_history:1]  

---

## Tech Overview

- Target engines/runtimes: Unreal, Unity, Godot, plus native desktop builds where applicable.[conversation_history:1]  
- Intended integration with existing cybernetic/BCI stacks (e.g., AU.ET‑style energy & safety ledgers, secure logging, and audit‑friendly design).[file:3]  
- Open formats for assets (PNG, simple JSON/ALN scene descriptions) to allow import/export into other creative tools.[conversation_history:1]  

---

## Project Goals

- Provide a high‑quality, open pixel‑art studio that BCI users can actually use and enjoy.  
- Offer a friendly first coding/creative environment for smart‑city, XR, and cybernetic research labs working with children and vulnerable populations.[file:2]  
- Serve as a reference implementation for safe, non‑invasive BCI entertainment software: deterministic, auditable, and energy‑bounded.[file:3]  

---

## License

Pixelz is intended to be released under a permissive open‑source license (e.g., Apache‑2.0 or MIT) so schools, clinics, and families can use and extend it freely.[file:2]

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome in areas such as:

- Accessibility UX (large icons, simplified flows, screen‑reader‑friendly layouts).[conversation_history:1]  
- BCI adapters (OpenBCI, LSL bridges) with strict safety constraints.[file:3]  
- Kid‑friendly templates, sprite packs, and lesson plans for creative learning.[conversation_history:1]  

Before contributing, please:

1. Open an issue describing your idea or fix.  
2. Make sure any BCI‑related code preserves non‑invasive, medically aligned safety envelopes.  
3. Follow the code style, testing, and hash‑based blueprint validation patterns used in the broader CEM/Cybercore ecosystem.[file:2][file:3]  

---

## Status

Pixelz is an active, evolving project in the CEM/Cybercore ecosystem, aiming to become a standard open tool for safe, inclusive, BCI‑aware pixel art and animation.[file:2]
